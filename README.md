## Technical details
### Stack
Since I didn't want to pay for any hosting, this project is built on the premise that there is no database and backend processing *per se*, so it can be deployed as a static site, e.g. on Netlify's free plan.

- Netlify (free plan)
- GitHub
- HTML/JS/CSS

My local backend: 
- Node.js scripts

About some challenges I encountered:
- different (mobile) browsers acting differently
- how to preload questions to avoid any visible stutter
- efficient CSS animations
- what is actually important

The way questions reach users:
0. **Gathering questions:** Google Forms, friends, other websites...
1. *Sorting & maintaining questions:* Google Sheets
2. *Adding the questions to GitHub folder "public/questions":*
2.a. Download questions to local computer as a .tsv file (*e.g.* "en-spicy.tsv")
2.b. Feed this file to "q-putter.mjs", which overwrites local "public/questions/"
