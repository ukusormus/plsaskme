# Technical details, rant and a bit about the process
<br>

### Stack
This project is built on the premise that __there is no database and backend processing *per se*__, so the whole thing can be deployed as a static site. Why pay for hosting if I don't have to?

- Website: **pure HTML/JS/CSS**
- Static hosting: **Netlify** (free plan)
- *Well, where are the questions?* As static assets, see [The way questions reach my happy users](#the-way-questions-reach-my-happy-users).

<br>

I still pay for two custom domain names, because they're cool together (at least I hope): __[askmepls.com]__ and __[plsaskme.com]__

For country detection, [ipregistry.co] API is used (fast, 100,000 requests for free).
Currently trying out [plausible.io] 30-day trial for analytics. I'll see what I'll do about it.


<br>

__Visual Studio Code__, its __Live Extension__ and __Google Chrome Dev__  used for local development. 

I still have needed to deploy a lot because some things (specifically CSS) don't just work the same way on my laptop and phone. Fortunately that hasn't been too much of a hustle, since with every push to GitHub, Netlify builds and deploys automatically, and that takes about 5 to 10 seconds.

<br>
<br>

### About some challenges I (have) encountered:
- Finding a good name (still not sure)
- KISSing (Keeping It Simple, Stupid) â€“ at the beginning, overthought my stack needs (tested out Firebase; thought too long if I should use Vue or *insert any other popular framework*, etc.)
- Different (mobile) browsers acting up differently and responsive design in general (*OMG!*, that Safari margin bug that I debugged until 3pm, didn't appear on my laptop)
- Getting my head around async / await / modules, [script loading priorities](https://addyosmani.com/blog/script-priorities/) (not good at all on these topics yet, still lots and lots to learn)
- How to preload questions to avoid wait
- How to design a good UI and smooth UX
- Non-laggy CSS animations
- Focusing on what's the most important to the user, not nitpicking insignificant details (and implementing non-essential features)

A great tool that is working out for me: taking a step back, using paper and pencil to sketch out stuff.

### The way questions reach my happy users:
0. **Gathering questions:** Google Forms, friends, other websites and question cards
1. **Sorting & maintaining questions:** Google Sheets
2. **Adding the questions to as static assets to `/public/questions/(lang)/(question nr)`:**

    2.a. Download questions to local computer as a `.tsv` file (*e.g.* `en-spicy.tsv`)

    2.b. Feed this file to `q-putter.mjs`, which overwrites local `public/questions/...` contents; add, commit, push to GitHub.

    2.c. Netlify deploys automatically on every push, saves questions from GitHub folder `public/questions` as static assets
        (e.g. there's a question at `/questions/en-spicy/17`)
3. **Fetching & displaying questions:** JavaScript Fetch API + local storage as question history mechanism.

`q-putter.mjs` is a Node.js script (uses Node modules `fs-extra` and `nreadlines`) that converts a `.tsv` file (downloaded from Google Sheets) into separate question files and a question count file (called `count`, to - well -, save the question count as a static asset). These files are pushed to GitHub folder "public/questions", **Netlify** saves them as static assets.

_Note_: I wanted to try out Node.js (and the "everything can be written in JavaScript" adage), that's why `q-putter` is in Node. May rewrite in Python in the future, would seem more logical and purer to me.

<br>
<br>

### Some useful stuff for Google Sheets:
- Data -> Sort Sheet (removes empty rows)
- Data -> Data Cleanup -> Remove duplicates
- To remove "107." from "107. What's your name?" when gathering questions from the interweebz: 
    CTRL F + regex `^\d+(\.|\,)\s+` (also works with commas, uneven spacing)
- Max length for questions is approximately 78 chars. I use _Conditional Formatting_ `=LEN(A1)>78` to make cells of too long strings go orange.
