## Technical details
### Stack
Since I'm a rat (hello!) and didn't want to pay for any hosting, this project is built on the premise that there is no database and backend processing *per se*, so the whole thing can be deployed as a static site. Right now that means:

- Netlify (free plan) / questions are saved from GitHub folder "public/questions" as static assets
- Pure HTML/JS/CSS

I still pay for two custom domain names, because they're cool. Right? askmepls.com and plsaskme.com

### My local "backend": 
- Node.js script `q-putter.js` (uses Node module `fs-extra`) that converts a .tsv file into separate question files and saves count.

Visual Studio Code and Live Extension came in handy.

### About some challenges I encountered:
- Finding a good name (still not sure)
- Different (mobile) browsers acting up differently (*OMG!*, that Safari margin bug that I debugged until 3pm) / responsive design in general
- How to preload questions to avoid wait
- Efficient animations
- Getting my head around async / await / modules (https://addyosmani.com/blog/script-priorities/); still not good at it
- Focusing on the important, not nitpicking details :)

### The way questions reach my happy users:
0. **Gathering questions:** Google Forms, friends (haha), other websites
1. **Sorting & maintaining questions:** Google Sheets
2. **Adding the questions to GitHub folder "public/questions":**
    2.a. Download questions to local computer as a .tsv file (*e.g.* "en-spicy.tsv")
    2.b. Feed this file to "q-putter.mjs", which overwrites local "public/questions/"; add, commit, push.
    2.c. Netlify deploys automatically on every push, saves questions from GitHub folder "public/questons" as static assets
        (e.g. there's a question at plsaskme.com/questions/en-spicy/17)
3. **Fetching & displaying questions:** JavaScript Fetch API + local storage as question history mechanism.

Some stuff for Sheets:
- Data -> Sort Sheet (removes empty rows)
- Data -> Data Cleanup -> Remove duplicates
- To remove "107." from "107. What's your name?" when gathering questions from the interweebz: 
    CTRL F + regex `^\d+(\.|\,)\s+` (also works with commas, uneven spacing)
